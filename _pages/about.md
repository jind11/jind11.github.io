I am now a Senior AI Research Scientist at Meta GenAI, contributing to developing LLAMA series of models. 

I have been doing NLP research for more than 8 years and published more than 70 papers in top AI conferences with more than 5k citations. 

I have a deep belief that AGI will come in my life.

Welcome to email to me if you would like to work with me on cool research on LLMs.
